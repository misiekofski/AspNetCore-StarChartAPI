# Build a Starchart Web API using ASP.NET Core

The Build a Starchart Web API using ASP.NET Core Application is designed to allow users to submit and retrieve data about celestial objects. This will cover using EntityFramework to retrieve, add, update, and remove data from an in memory database and making it accessible via a web service.

# This application was done as practice for pluralsight interactive tutorial

After that I've moved forward.

- [x] Added Swagger to show API documentation
- [x] Upgraded .net core to 2.2
- [x] Fixed some tests to be more flexible with checking endpoints (now you can add custom endpoint)
- [x] Added some json examples and documentation to code

Future plans:
- [ ] Dockerize service properly
- [ ] Add db source instead of using memory (dockerized)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for Azure
- [ ] Add more models and endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication & secure Web API
- [ ] Implement caching
